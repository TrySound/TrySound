## Hi there 👋

I love Web and Open Source. Building stuff here for more than a decade.

Currently working on:
- [Engramma](https://github.com/TrySound/engramma) - design tokens tool to help me create and manage design systems
- [Webstudio](https://github.com/webstudio-is/webstudio) - visual website builder and Webflow alternative

Previously maintained:
- [Postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) - a tool for transforming CSS
- [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) - javascript bundler
- [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) - SVG images minifier

Open to contract work as a Frontend Engineer.

I care deeply about performance, web standards and DX. Previously shipped design tools, CRM systems and developer tooling.
